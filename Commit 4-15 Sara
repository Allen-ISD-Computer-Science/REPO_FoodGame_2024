I am adding the link to an online repository for the Roblox NPC's to be able to hold items like an ice cream cone. https://devforum.roblox.com/t/putting-a-tool-onto-an-npc-hands/221626/4 . 
The goal is that the character will not get the ice cream until after they order and it will disappear after they eat.
